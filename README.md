# De Rham thoerem
In this brief exposition we prove De Rham theorem, which states that
De Rham and singular cohomology, over a paracompact manifold,
are isomorphic. Moreover we prove the explicit form of this isomorphism,
given by the integration of forms on singular simplices. This result is
proved using F-injective resolutions and tools from sheaf theory.
